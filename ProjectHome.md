AudioSwitch is started from several similar projects and developed further to fit my personal vision of the final solution. Here are the sources which are used:
  1. http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18520/Vista-Core-Audio-API-Master-Volume-Control - base library to interface between devices and C#. All copyright notices remain in files but I have removed/modified/optimized a lot of the code in some way.
  1. http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1656534 - main start-up ideas and code for the initial GUI. I disassembled the GUI exe to get the initial code for the popup; I hope the original author/OP don't mind ;)
